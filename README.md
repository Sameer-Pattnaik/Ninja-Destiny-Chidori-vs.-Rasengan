- **Attributes:**
  - `x`, `y`: Position of Naruto.
  - `width`, `height`: Size of the player sprite.
  - `speed`: Movement speed.
  - `isjump`: Boolean indicating if Naruto is jumping.
  - `jumpheight`: Height of the jump.
  - `left`, `right`: Movement direction.
  - `health`: Health of Naruto.
- **Methods:**
  - `draw(win)`: Renders Naruto on the screen and displays the health bar.
  - `hit()`: Reduces Naruto's health upon collision with Sasuke.

#### **2. Weapons Class (`weapons`)**
Represents shurikens Naruto throws.
- **Attributes:**
  - `x`, `y`: Position of the shuriken.
  - `width`, `height`: Size of the shuriken.
  - `facing`: Direction of the shuriken (-1 for left, 1 for right).
  - `vel`: Velocity of the shuriken.
- **Methods:**
  - `draw(win)`: Renders the shuriken.

#### **3. Enemy Class (`enemy`)**

### **Adding Pictures**

#### **Steps to Include Pictures in the Documentation:**
1. **Prepare Images:** Take screenshots or export the necessary assets, such as the game interface, character sprites, and health bars.
2. **Embed Images:** Save the images in the documentation folder and reference them like this:
   ```markdown
   ![Game Screenshot](photos/game_screenshot.png)
   ```
3. **Example Sections:**
   - **Game Preview:**
     ![Game Screenshot](photos/game_preview.png)
   - **Naruto vs. Sasuke:**
     ![Naruto and Sasuke](photos/naruto_sasuke_preview.png)

#### **Tips for Screenshots:**
- Use the `pygame.image.save()` function to capture game screenshots directly:
  ```python
  pygame.image.save(win, "photos/game_screenshot.png")
  ```

### **Possible Enhancements**
1. **Add Multiplayer Mode:** Allow a second player to control Sasuke.
2. **Improve Visuals:** Add advanced animations for attacks like Rasengan and Chidori.
3. **Power-Ups:** Include items that restore health or boost speed temporarily.
4. **Boss Battle:** Add other characters as unlockable bosses.
5. **High Scores:** Display the winner's score at the end of the game.
